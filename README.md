# Industrial Revolution Inventions
This little project is telling the story of some very useful things invented during the exciting period in modern history known to us as an Industrial Revolution (1760-1840). It is difficult to overestimate a significance of technical development which occured during that period of time.

We immediately recall a ubiquitous steam engine each time we hear 'Industrial Revolution'. This is probably the most recognisable invention. Iconic feature - the Hogwarts Express. The steam engine powered train is departing from King's Cross station, platform 9 3/4 in London on the image above.

The present project tells more about some inventions we use every day and take for granted (except for a marine chronometer, which enabled safe navigation, great geographical discoveries and global trade). You will learn a bit about personalities beyond each invention and, of course the story of success when each invention was commerciolised. The project tells about five objects only - a drop in the ocean. We would require a serios research work to unvail this prolific period.

The page contains main text, links to corresponding pages on Wikipedia and to little magazine or newspaper notes which a curious mind will find interesting. For a better experience use a full-screen pc to browse. Finally, the page has a form where you can choose what else you would like to learn about history of technology.
